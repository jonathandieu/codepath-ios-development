Submitted by: **Jonathan Dieu**

**Jontroduction** is a simple app that provides a short description of my name, the school I attend, and my job title.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Here is a list of some of my favorite applications and the features that justify holding such a high opinion of them:
- **Snapchat**: Watching Snapchat evolve from its core functionality as a camera app to a friend location tracker, news source, and even platform for AI- I've grown accustomed to seeing them try new things while also staying fairly innovative in terms of features that I wish were more prevalent like swipe-to-reply and text formatting.
- **Apple Maps**: Even though I still use Google Maps out of habit, I can see they've made leaps and bounds in terms of trying to outdo their competitor with features like Apple Watch integration and a minimalistic UI.
- **Google Authenticator**: After sticking with this app for years of improvement, I could appreciate the level of effort that went into implementing and maintaining requested features like transferring authentication keys to another device when logged into the same account.
- **Spotify**: One of the most beloved platforms for streaming and listening to great songs, it's only natural that they would be among the best apps in terms of user-experience, with consistent polish of their UI as well as their feature set. I've had a love/hate relationship with Car Mode, but removing the ability to swipe to delete songs was long awaited and requested.

## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered while building the app was trying to learn the ins and outs of Xcode, with some of the toughest struggles being trying to find a way to open the inspector that I needed to open in order to properly remove a connection that I accidentally created in the ViewController :')

If I had to think about planning to build an app, I think it would be something that can address one of the problems that have plagued me for a long time now: an app that can run on both iOS and MacOS. I would like for it to solve some problem that I commonly run into but haven't bothered automating just yet. I think it could be as simple as a utility to show me when my next meetings in the day are.
